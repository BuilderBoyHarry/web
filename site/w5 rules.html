    <ul>
        <li>To claim land, you must mark it out correctly, otherwise another play may claim it.</li>
        <li>To mark out land, you must have a marking or anything else built at ground level on it.</li>
        <li>The marking must be at the terrain’s Y-level.</li>
        <li>A sky base more than 32 block above ground level must be marked at ground level, otherwise another play may claim it.</li>
        <li>An underground base must be marked at ground level regardless of its depth, otherwise another play may claim it.</li>
        <li>If the terrain has multiple layers, an overhang for example, place the marking closest to Y-level 63.</li>
        <li>A marking can’t be obstructed by the terrain and must be clearly visible to all players. If a piece of land is marked underground, another player may claim the land.</li>
        <li>If land is claimed in a loop then anything inside it for 32 blocks around the interior of the loop is owned. If rightfully claimed land is inside of the loop then the 32 block thing doesn’t take into effect. In other words, just use common sense with this whole land thing.</li>
        <li>When land is claimed, the player also claims everything above and below it, including all Y level space up and down (until the height limit is reached).</li>
        <li>People can dig/mine underneath claimed land unless a structure is in the way.</li>
        <li>To rightfully own land you must have claimed it before anyone else has claimed it or acquired it from someone else who rightfully owned it.</li>
        <li>To rightfully acquire land from someone you must have their permission, or have bought it from them (obviously you must have their permission to buy it).</li>
        <li>If someone builds something on your land, the rightful owner of that land may destroy it. If you destroy a building on land you do not own, it will be considered griefing.</li>
        <li>Griefing, destroying something someone has built, etc., will be punished accordingly but only if the victim requests it.</li>
        <li>Pranking, for example building a mustache on someone’s statue, is allowed but please respect the requests of the victim beforehand.</li>
        <li>Stealing from another player is not permitted and stolen items must be returned or repaid as per the server owner.</li>
        <li>Spamming is fine as long as it isn’t inappropriate or offensive.</li>
        <li>Do not kill other players who obviously don’t want to be killed.</li>
        <li>Do not putting armor class items that can’t be destroyed through loss of durability (a dragon head for example) that also have a curse of binding enchantment onto other players without their permission.</li>
        <li>Players may create governments/factions, but keep in mind that other players don’t have to follow their laws/rules.</li>
    </ul>
